This is a simple yougurt incubator that uses an arduino mega, a relay shield, and a space heater to make doi (yogurt) on a large scale in an upcycled beverege fridge. In this repository are: 
* [Fusion 360](../master/fusion) drawings for the power supply panel, the front panel, and an enclosure.
* [Eagle](../master/eagle) sketch of basic circuit diagram for logic and power supply including relevant shields
* [Arduino](../master/arduino) main program code

## See the [wiki](https://github.com/cdyn/kkClave/wiki) for installtion, fabrication, and use details.

## TODO:
*  implement ethernet
*  add cooling cycle features
*  handle clock overflow
